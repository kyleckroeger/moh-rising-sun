# Research notes

Research contributions help identify formats, recover names and choose useful
GameCube reconstruction targets. Thanks to [kyleckroeger](https://github.com/kyleckroeger)
for sharing seven investigations from a separate PS2 remake effort, following
[issue #4](https://github.com/lifewillbeokay/moh-rising-sun/issues/4).

## PS2 investigations and GameCube comparisons

These notes target PS2 SLUS-20753 and include scoped comparisons against the pinned
GameCube GR8E69 executable. Each document records its evidence, confidence and open
questions. The contributor used Claude to help prepare and re-check the notes;
maintainer review and corrections used Codex. Preserve that attribution when using
the research.

## Applying the notes

The script dispatch table and named built-in functions provide concrete places to
start reconstructing the script interpreter and small wrappers. The `.sin` and
`.bpd` notes help interpret records used by class lookup and endian-conversion
routines. FlexProp and particle research can extend the already matching
[lookup path](../FlexProp.md) and [recipe accessors](../ParticleRecipes.md).

The first source contribution based on these notes now reconstructs [16 script
handlers, event lookup and three music built-ins](../Script.md), with each accepted
body checked independently against GameCube. That evidence is separate from the
broader PS2 interpretations in the research documents.

The [BPD reconstruction](../BPD.md) also includes matching conversion routines for
the header, property records, animated lights and light volumes, plus a lighting-volume
point test and scalar conversion wrappers. Its scoped views preserve unknown fields
and do not establish complete GameCube file formats.

The [camera reconstruction](../Camera.md) applies the runtime notes' half-angle
finding to matching projection setters, FOV getters, projection-matrix updates
and transform wrappers. Each function and accessed field is checked against
GameCube independently of the PS2 interpretation.

PS2 offsets, endianness and file contents do not automatically establish GameCube
layouts. A CRC match is a naming lead, and a shared symbol or call is evidence for
an interface, not a complete implementation. Check each proposed GameCube function
and storage view against GR8E69 before accepting source. Original PS2 file claims
remain attributed to the contributor where maintainer review could not reproduce
them independently.

These documents earn no matching-source credit. Accepted source must pass the
[complete-image verification and snapshot process](../Progress.md). Keep game
files and bulk research dumps in ignored local directories; see the
[contribution guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
