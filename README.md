# Medal of Honor: Rising Sun

An early matching decompilation of **Medal of Honor: Rising Sun** for GameCube, targeting the USA release **GR8E69, Disc 1, revision 0**. The initial game-code target is the disc's `MOH3RDVD.ELF`.

[![Verified progress snapshot](https://github.com/lifewillbeokay/moh-rising-sun/actions/workflows/progress.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lifewillbeokay/moh-rising-sun/actions/workflows/progress.yml)

**See [current matching progress and unfinished functions on decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev/lifewillbeokay/moh-rising-sun).** The project combines reconstructed game-specific C++ with compatible public library reconstructions, including Lua, Dolphin SDK, Newlib, GCC runtime, STLport and network helpers. Accepted source is checked against the original executable as part of a complete rebuilt analysis-image comparison. The remainder stays original binary context. AI-assisted contributions are welcome; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Progress counts verified, nonoverlapping source-built function bytes against all bytes in the original executable sections (`.init` and `.text`). Generated data and BSS are verified separately and earn no code-progress credit; neither do stripped functions, original context or debug metadata. Exact counts and input hashes live in the [verified snapshot](progress/GR8E69.snapshot.json). See [how progress is verified and published](docs/Progress.md) and the [reuse index](docs/ReuseMap.md) for library provenance, evidence and next work.

## Verified starting point

- `MOH3RDVD.ELF`: 3,628,980 bytes; SHA-1 `dd797412be7d631e78c98f194a1bb47981174d75`.
- 15,507 symbol entries, including 9,883 function entries and 954 source-file entries. Entries are not necessarily unique functions or complete original source units.
- Preserved DWARF 1 information covers seven Nintendo GBA-library compilation units. It is not full game-wide type information.
- The original-object relink matches the complete 2,860,576-byte DOL derived from the ELF, including its header. Every original allocated ELF file byte, entry point, and BSS extent is checked separately.
- Accepted game and library source passes that same complete-image comparison. Code and generated data are both checked; reconstructed game code and restored library code are reported separately. The [project manifest](config/GR8E69/project.json) lists accepted units and fragments.

This comparison is against a derived analysis image. It does **not** mean the original ELF's debug/symbol tables have been reproduced, the on-disc boot DOL has been replaced, or the game has been tested in an emulator. The boot DOL is a separate 206,016-byte program containing references to the game ELFs.

## Progress integration

Explore the [live decomp.dev map](https://decomp.dev/lifewillbeokay/moh-rising-sun)
to find unfinished functions. The remaining code is divided into grey boxes:
named file groups where supported by symbols, unknown-file groups, shared entry
points and unidentified bytes. Inferred ownership is labeled and earns no matching
credit. See [code-map evidence and starting points](docs/CodeMap.md) and the
[reuse index and ranked next work](docs/ReuseMap.md). The new
[direct dependency map](docs/Dependencies.md) ranks shared helpers by unfinished
callers and preserves unresolved indirect calls.

The [progress workflow](.github/workflows/progress.yml) publishes an objdiff v2
`GR8E69_report` artifact compatible with decomp.dev. CI validates source hashes
against a locally verified snapshot; it does not rebuild the game. Source changes
require a fresh local complete-image verification before their progress can be
published. See [progress reporting and registration](docs/Progress.md).

## Local setup

Requires Python 3.9+ and macOS ARM64. Source compilation also uses existing Rosetta support. Tools are downloaded into ignored `build/tools/` and `build/compiler/` with pinned SHA-256 checksums. ProDG 3.8.1 with `-O2 -G0` is the working MathFun profile; the restored Lua library adds `-ffast-math` and uses native unused-function stripping. The SDK units use CodeWarrior GC/1.2.5n; EXI uses `-O3,p`, the other SDK units use `-O4,p`, with `-opt nopeep` for the documented fragments. Newlib libc uses ProDG 3.8.1 with `-O2 -G8 -fsigned-char -DMB_CAPABLE`; math uses `-O2 -G1024 -fno-builtin -msafe-sda` and the language profiles in [Newlib.md](docs/Newlib.md). GCC runtime helpers use `-O2 -G8`. The original compiler releases remain unconfirmed.

```sh
python3 tools/import_disc.py "/path/to/Medal of Honor - Rising Sun (USA) (Disc 1).nkit.iso"
python3 tools/setup.py
python3 tools/audit.py
python3 tools/baseline.py
python3 tools/reconstruct.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The importer reads the standard GameCube filesystem table, including the provided uncompressed NKit v01 image. It extracts only four pinned executables into `orig/GR8E69/`, checks their sizes and SHA-1/SHA-256 digests, and leaves the input image untouched. This does not recover or verify a full retail-disc image. Other compressed formats and other revisions are not currently supported.

Run the scripts from any directory; all outputs remain inside this checkout. `baseline.py` and `reconstruct.py` recreate their own build directories, so keep experiments under `scratch/`.

The automatic dtk ELF split export emits warnings for this executable's symbol ordering. Treat it as research output; it is not accepted source ownership. The baseline uses a separate original-object split and retains every compared byte.

## Next work

1. Extend the [verified CMatrix family](docs/Matrix.md) using its shared layout; establish CVector3 construction and full storage before adding functions that need local vectors. The [dependency ranking](docs/Dependencies.md) also identifies small string and allocation helpers. Extend the verified STL container profile only after resolving custom comparator and by-value game-type layouts. The remaining MathFun functions need floating-point constant/layout evidence.
2. Distinguish the original compiler release using larger functions. Five tested SN/ProDG versions match the accepted fragment, so its byte match alone cannot identify the original release. Nintendo libraries may use different compilers.
3. Extend the network-library subset by recovering the older target's behavior and storage; the remaining TCP, UDP, PPP and Ethernet reference routines differ. Continue shared game-code reconstruction alongside library restoration. Only compiled source bytes that pass complete-image verification count toward progress.
4. Inspect Disc 2 and test the game's executable-loading path before claiming complete game coverage or a runnable replacement disc.

## Tooling

Uses [decomp-toolkit](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit) 1.8.4, [gc-wii-binutils](https://github.com/encounter/gc-wii-binutils) 2.42-2, and [wibo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo) 1.0.3. The project layout follows the separation of originals, source and build output documented by [dtk-template](https://github.com/encounter/dtk-template); its standard CodeWarrior build configuration has not been adopted for the SN-compiled game code.
